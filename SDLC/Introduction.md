**SDLC** 

**Introduction** 

Software Development Life Cycle is a structured approach to **design, develop, test and deploy** software applications by software developers. It guides us to build a project **efficiently, meets user requirements, delivers on time and within budget**. SDLC is mainly used to **build a quality project**.** 

**Phases** 

- Requirement Gathering & Analysis 
- Design 
- Coding 
- Testing 
- Deployment 
- Maintenance & Support 

**Requirement Gathering & Analysis** 

In this phase, Developers **collect and analyze the project requirements 
from stakeholders** (the people who have an influence in the software project) to understand the system’s **objectives, requirements and functionalities**. With the help of gathered details, they prepare **SRS (Software Requirement Specification).** 

**Design** 

In this phase, Developers **design the architecture and components** for the software like blueprints **(HLD & LLD)** for the project. 

High-Level Design - Focus on system architecture, modules and data flow. 

Low-Level Design - Detailed logical algorithms and individual components. 

**Coding** 

In this phase, Developers **write the code** in their appropriate programming languages. Also, they do **unit testing, version control**, etc. 

**Testing**  

In this phase, Once the development completed, the software undergoes various types of testing to **identify and resolve bugs and issues**. Testing includes **functional testing, system testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing**, etc. Testing people finally deliver test reports to resolve the bugs. 

**Deployment**  

After successful testing, the software is **released to the production 
environment**. Also include user training and the setup of user documentation.** 

**Maintenance & Support**  

It involves **fixing bugs, performance issues, adding new features** and ensuring the software continues to operate as expected over time. Developers give **version updates** to support software performance and features.**
